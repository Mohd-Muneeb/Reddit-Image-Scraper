This is a project made in pure javascript

Huge shout out to all the awesome people who made all the packages I have used in this project.

Packages used :

    *Cheerio*
    *Express*
    *axios*
    *puppeteer*

Thank you for all of you.

*Working*

This works in 2 steps 
    The index file generates a Text file which contains of the src info of the picture
    the test file finally uses the puppeteer package to screenshot the image and saves it to images folder.

*Thank you all*
Made with pure passion, Muneeb Mohd.
